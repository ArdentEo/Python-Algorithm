<h1>Algorithm for file updates in Python</h1>

<h2> Project Description</h2>
An organization needs the ability to control which users have access to restricted content based on their IP addresses. I use an example file known as the “allow_list.txt” file and a remove list file that contains user IP addresses based on whether they have authorization to access restricted content or need to be removed. This document entails how I create a Python algorithm designed to sift through an existing list of approved IP addresses, pinpointing and removing any that are no longer granted access.
